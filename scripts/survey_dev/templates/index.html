			<h2>RESEARCH CONSENT INFORMATION</h2>
			<h3>Cross-linguistic Evaluation of Readability</h3>
			<p>You are being asked to participate in a research study. Scientists do research to answer important
                questions that might help change or improve the way we do things in the future.	This document will give
                you information about the study to help you decide whether you want to participate. Please read this
                form, and ask any questions you have, before agreeing to be in the study.</p>
			<p>All research is voluntary. You can choose not to take part in this study. If you decide to
                participate, you can change your mind later and leave the study at any time. You will not be penalized
                or lose any benefits if you decide not to participate or choose to leave the study later. This research
                is intended for individual 18 years of age or older. If you are under age 18, do not complete the survey.</p>
			<p>The purpose of this study is to develop computational methods of determining the difficulty of
                sentences based on speaker input on difficulty. We are asking you if you want to be in this study
                because you have language skills in one of the languages of this study. The study is being conducted
                by Alexandra O'Neil, Department of Linguistics at Indiana University.</p>
			<p>If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things.
                <ul>
                    <li>You will evaluate 100 pairs of sentence and decide which sentence in the pair is more difficult
                        using this online survey tool. </li>
                    <li>This is expected to take no longer than an hour and will be done once. </li>
                    <li>This survey does not utilize ongoing participation and will be complete when you finish the
                        survey.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
			<p>Before agreeing to participate, please consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part in
                this study. We donâ€™t think you will have any personal benefits from taking part in this study, but we
                hope to learn things that will help researchers in the future. You will not be paid for participating
                in this study. There is no cost to participate in the study.</p>
            <p>We will protect your information and make every effort to keep your personal information confidential,
                but we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. No information which could identify you will be shared
                in publications about this study. Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if
                required by law. We also may need to share your research records with other groups for quality assurance
                or data analysis. These groups include the Indiana University Institutional Review Board or its designees,
                and state or federal agencies who may need to access the research records (as allowed by law). </p>
            <p>If you have questions about the study or encounter a problem with the research, contact the
                researcher, Alexandra O'Neil at aconeil@iu.edu. For questions about your rights as a research participant, to discuss problems, complaints, or
                concerns about a research study, or to obtain information or to offer input, please contact the IU
