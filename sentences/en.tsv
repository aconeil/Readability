112	2	Old man!
113	2	My car!
114	2	Must be.

144	2	The prosecution.
145	2	Quiet down!
146	2	Follow me.
147	2	Not now!
148	2	Thanks again.

150	2	Two dead.
151	2	Get cracking!
152	2	Very profound.
153	2	It does.
154	2	We're sorry!
155	2	You blind?
156	2	We are.
157	2	I'm tired.
158	2	Good show.
159	2	Oh, yeah.
160	2	It's humiliating!
161	2	You're lovely.

167	2	Let's drink.
168	2	Defibrillator, clear!
169	2	For you?
170	2	I’ll apologise.
171	2	You can.
172	2	Don't interrupt.
173	2	What's that?
174	2	Like that?
175	2	Then what?
176	2	Battalion, halt.
177	2	Oh, auntie.
178	2	Sleeps dressed.
179	2	The cot?
180	2	God damn
181	2	It's nothing.
182	2	Invisible ink?
183	2	Beautiful, everyone.
184	2	Think carefully!
185	2	Hey, checkmate.
186	2	It's delicious.
187	2	About anarchism
188	2	Sleep well.
189	2	Nothing yet.
190	2	It depends.
191	2	Access denied.
192	2	Calm down.
193	2	Do me!
194	2	Have you?
195	2	Now what?
196	2	Very funny!
197	2	Eat it.
198	2	Behave yourself!
199	2	That long?
200	2	I'll wait.
201	3	Organize the proletariat.
202	3	Take you away?
203	3	It is important.
204	3	The mystery's gone.
205	3	Some have spots.
206	3	Anyone can enter.
207	3	It's the principle.
208	3	I hate her.
209	3	Does it matter?
210	3	He seemed stunned.
211	3	He's a fatalist.
212	3	You've lost nothing.
213	3	My head hurts!
214	3	Please take care.
215	3	Few were exported.
216	3	Because of you.
217	3	He left issue.
218	3	Call my sister.
219	3	The bid failed.
220	3	Your key, madam.
221	3	The cab's stopping.
222	3	See them cups?
223	3	Will he come?
224	3	You were there.
225	3	They had not.
226	3	That's a fact!
227	3	He was recalled.
228	3	And that's all.
229	3	I've got indigestion.
230	3	So smartly dressed!
231	3	He was stopped.
232	3	Because you're yellow.
233	3	Scientists say so.
234	3	Which it did.
235	3	Good evening, lady.
236	3	You are right.
237	3	It's so early!
238	3	I was robbed.
239	3	That devastated me.
240	3	Wetter times returned.
241	3	Geared towards audiophiles.
242	3	No use bluffing.
243	3	He declined renomination.
244	3	It disappeared rapidly.
245	3	Is he rich?
246	3	You're very flattering.
247	3	See march music.
248	3	Orchards were common.
249	3	Adversity tries friends.
250	3	A great deal.
251	3	Turn it down!
252	3	Missing your girlfriend?
253	3	An anti-pattern nowadays.
254	3	Will he live?

258	3	Internet penetration blossomed.
259	3	This is trouble
260	3	Good, everyone's here

264	3	Kids going hungry.
265	3	None was preserved.
266	3	Fine wedding, huh?
267	3	There she is.
268	3	Directed by reason.
269	3	Oh, it's gorgeous!
270	3	Let's get it.
271	3	Oh, don't worry.
272	3	They were hunter-gatherers.
273	3	With sixteen illustrations.
274	3	He had cancer.
275	3	It was funny.
276	3	Clean the kitchen.
277	3	We're broken up.
278	3	Repairs were planned.
279	3	Ultimately, workers succeed.
280	3	Well done, sir!
281	3	Is this fair?
282	3	They later separated.
283	3	Haste makes waste.
284	3	I enjoyed it.
285	3	Let's see it!
286	3	Average hourly earnings.
287	3	Giraffes are vegetarians.
288	3	I'm a doctor!
289	3	Come over here.
290	3	Hush, my darling!
291	3	They looked up.
292	3	He destroyed me.
293	3	I'll do it.
294	3	They later divorced.
295	3	Wasn't that nonsensical?
296	3	Isn't marriage great?
297	3	You're dreaming, man.
298	3	Where is she?
299	3	It's really true.
300	3	You're very pretty.
301	4	The market has fragmented.
302	4	It was to long.
303	4	It made little difference.
304	4	These planes lacked cannon.
305	4	This species is univoltine.
306	4	I don't forget anything.

317	4	His vanity is colossal.
318	4	It was never mounted.

320	4	Out of the question.
321	4	It contains of earth.
322	4	It is a trap.

324	4	They would all come.
325	4	What about my pictures?
326	4	Four thousand were arrested.
327	4	So I said, why?
328	4	In the living corpse!
329	4	Governor of different parties.
330	4	Her skirt was raised.
331	4	My foot got caught.
332	4	However, she was acquitted.
333	4	Numerous endings are possible.
334	4	He was a glue-sniffer?
335	4	Won't you sit down?
336	4	But that's about it.
337	4	He did not return.
338	4	It is usually generalised.
339	4	What do you think?
340	4	I hadn't the nerve.
341	4	Both vessels sustained damage.
342	4	The trees include chestnuts.
343	4	Give me my money!
344	4	That made him guilty.
345	4	Gone to bed, eh?
346	4	Give the best drink.
347	4	The newspapers demanded democracy.
348	4	Where are you going?
349	4	See the list below.
350	4	Many vendors operate illegally.

352	4	Maybe it’s a woman.
353	4	Patience is a virtue.
354	4	I get a royalty.
355	4	Then their paths diverged.
356	4	Her coffin eventually disappeared.
357	4	He also studied philosophy.
358	4	It is that important.
359	4	I needed a break.
360	4	Each level was different.
361	4	Of course I am!
362	4	She has average self-awareness.
363	4	These are mid-sized supermarkets.
364	4	You're stealing my idea!
365	4	It comprises eight genera.
366	4	Man, you've hit it!
367	4	They are not included.
368	4	She apparently didn't listen.
369	4	The idea was short-lived.
370	4	Mark the difference, moreover
371	4	It's grotesque, no doubt.
372	4	You don't mind that?
373	4	I pressed the bell.
374	4	Those miniatures were humans.
375	4	He was again expelled.
376	4	What is happening here?
377	4	Social tensions ran high.

389	4	The agreement was reached.
390	4	Consider though, the themes.
391	4	Let's stop it there
392	4	Did you make contact?
393	4	I hated that cover.
394	4	I don't want it.
395	4	New subjects were developed.
396	4	Do as you're told.
397	4	Better safe than sorry.
398	4	What in the world?
399	4	My contract just expired.
400	4	Give us a hand.
401	5	He's going nowhere at all.
402	5	This tactic often proved effective.
403	5	The club went into turmoil.
404	5	Are limes the fashion now?
405	5	Why isn't my bill paid?
406	5	So you gave him notice?
407	5	It also incorporates synthpop elements.

445	5	He had one younger sister.
446	5	That's where I wanna stay
447	5	Both publications are published quarterly.

536	6	You and I will die anyway.
537	6	You and the others spread out.
