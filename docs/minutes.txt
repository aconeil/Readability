Nick. write an outline of the xbox algorithm
Alex. watch a youtube video and/or read wikipedia article Maximum likelihood estimation
Alex. figure out how to find the maximum or minimum of a single-variable function using scipy (scipy.optimize)

```
# maximum should be at x=17
def f(x):
  return (x - 17) ** 2 + 18
```

For Xbox optimisation, need:
- multivariate normal distribution (mean vector and covariance matrix)
- how to integral for that, for inequalities x < y

Alex. read the wikipedia page on normal distribution
Alex. repeat the scipy-optimise-tutorial, but with f(x,y) = (x-5)**2 * (y - 2)**2 - (y - 3)**2 * (x - 1)**2
Nick. figure out how to draw
Nick. write an outline of the xbox algorithm
Nick. set up readability so that it's running -- OK, show alex how to run/restart the server (
  FLASK_APP=main.py flask run -p 17000
)
Nick. write instructions to hook git up with tlazolteotl -- tldr: git remote add origin tlazolteotl.nlhowell.org:Readability, git pull / git push

IRB hates us, loves cookies.


Alex. learn how to read a cookie in flask
Alex. learn how to write a cookie in flask
Alex. repeat scipy-optimise-tutorial for 2-dimensional normal distribution, compute parameters which maximise probability x > y > 3

??? Alex. move the consent page to a separate .html template; add code to check for consent cookie, if not present, show the consent page.

??? Alex. repeat scipy-optimise-tutorial for 2-dimensional normal distribution with *two* independent observations, x > y and y > 3. (do you get the same answer?)

??? Alex. repeat scipy-optimise-tutorial for N-dimensional normal distribution and an arbitrary list of comparisons (each gets multiplied); maximise likelihood and compute the mean and covariance
